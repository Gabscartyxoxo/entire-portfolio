     </a>
        <p>In this part of the project, I didn't really know a lot about coding, so I was really just focusing on taking stuff out and putting other stuff in. I wasn't super familiar with the style code either.</p>
    </div>

              </div>
     </a>
        <p>This second project was a lot easier, I could play more with colors and themes. And this time I understood more about how to tweak the style css. I also liked using my own photos and creating a photo gallery. </p>

        <p>For this I was inspired by 2000s interfaces. If I had more time, I'd do something like this, but I also was trying to mimmick the simplicity of html style websites at the time that would lead to more complex.</p>

           <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left">I really felt like this was a good balance between complex and artistry. I still have a lot to learn in terms of HTML, but I really enjoyed including my interests like photography and 2000s nastolgia.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
        <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
  <p style="text-align: left"> Though I wasn't there for 2 of the project showings, but I really enjoy how they're worked into the class. It gives us as students some room for feedback and be able to workshop any problems we had before showing everyone. And it was so cool to see other people's pieces and use them for inspiration and be able to ask them what they did.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left">There was a lot to think about when puting this project together, so many different ideas that could be used, and so many different ways they could possibly be executed. I really just focused more on what things I liked and thought about how to execute them.</p>

  <p style="text-align: left">I used a ton of stacked overflow and W3 to figure out how to do certain things. Some things I pulled off, but there is definitely more out there that I would like to learn to do. I think I definitely will keep working on website building, as I do really enjoy it. For my last project in particular, I used the internet archives to find older 2000s websites to link. </p>

        <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>

     <h3 class="margin">Phase 2/3 Course Goals</h3>

  <h4><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">This phase was certainly harder than the last.It was a lot more skill building and learning than the first one, and some skills I'm still not great at. However it wasn't interesting to learn more apps in the adobe suite, I've only been experienced with maybe three of them. The projects were pretty interesting though and it was cool to see what other people turned in as well. </p>
     <br>
        <h4><em>2.	Engage with others in a workshop environment</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">Like I said before, it was cool seeing what other people had to show on class days. When I talked to some of the other people we were working in groups with and they agreed that some of the assignments were tougher in this phase, but a lot of people had really interesting projects to share.</p>
      <br>
        <h4><em>3.	Think deeply about craft</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">In phase 2, I think that I definitely was able to learn more skills that can apply to the final project, it gave me more things to think about.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>4.	Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">I really liked the research that we've been doing the last couple of weeks. I feel like it gave me a lot more structure in what I was doing for my project. It was nice to be able to organize my thoughts and explore different ideas. I really liked the article I read about wearable sculptures, it was very abstract but head great points to add to my discussion.</p>
      <br>
            <h4><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></h4>
  <p style="text-align: left">I don't really have anything to add from before. It's good practice to present our projects in class, it doesn't the other times I have to present in other classes less daunting.</p>

  <div class="row">
  <div class="col-sm-4">
         <p><em>1. Foster the creative habits of mind</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">This phase of the project was kind of the end all be all of this class. That being said, it was a demonstration of all of the skills  that we had learned in our class so far and puting them together. For my project I picked a topic that I both enjoy and know well, black people (espcially) women in fashion. I especially enjoyed learning and researching different sectors of fashion and history and being able to put it together in a webpage interactive experience.</p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>2. Engage with others in a workshop environment.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">Though I wasn't there for the final showing of projects, reflecting on the classes leading up to the showcase, it was really interesting to see other people's projects. Overall, that was the best part of the class in general. I'm usually a person who hates presenting and can be rather shy in presenting my material. I really liked sitting in class and listening to peoples passions, ideas, interests, and thoughts. I think a lot of my classmates had really cool things that they worked on.</p>
      </div>
        <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>3.	Think deeply about craft. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As I explained in the beginning, I picked a topic that I know on a personal level and that I find interesting enough to do research on. The way in which I presented the project took the most thinking. I really wanted to get better at understanding html and website building, and I can say that I've improved since the first time earlier this semester. I learned to add videos and photos. I learned to change text font, text color. I learned to make images bigger upon hovering with the mouse. I learned to link one website to other websites that I built. I learned some background affects. I learned about code organization. There's a ton of other things that I could include, but most of all I learned patience with code. Coding can be frustrating and it can take a while, but luckily I was able to carve out time to research and use my resources so I didn't get completely lost.</p>

  <div class="col-sm-2">
     </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>4. Engage in sustained research and skills development. </em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">This project took a lot of time and research. I learned a lot about fashion as an art form and way to express culture. And as stated previously, A lot of research went into the coding aspect of this project. I wish I had the time and energy to do more, but I do have some ideas for future projects.</p>
      </div>
          <div class="col-sm-4">
      <p><em>5. Learn to present your work</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left">As discussed before I really valued the time to share projects and classwork. I'm still not the kind of person who enjoys presenting in front of the class, but I've gotten generally better at it and I enjoy hearing feedback as well.</p>
